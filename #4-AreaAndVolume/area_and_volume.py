"""Exercise Description

You will write four functions for this exercise. The functions area() and perimeter() have length and width parameters and the functions volume() and surfaceArea() have length, width, and height parameters. These functions return the area, perimeter, volume, and surface area, respectively.

The formulas for calculating area, perimeter, volume, and surface area are based on the length (L), width (W), and height (H) of the shape:

·       area = L × W

·       perimeter = L + W + L + W

·       volume = L × W × H

·       surface area = (L × W × 2) + (L × H × 2) + (W × H × 2)

Area is a two-dimensional measurement from multiplying length and width. Perimeter is the sum of all of the four one-dimensional lines around the rectangle. Volume is a three-dimensional measurement from multiplying length, width, and height. Surface area is the sum of all six of the two-dimensional areas around the cube. Each of these areas comes from multiplying two of the three length, width, or height dimensions.
